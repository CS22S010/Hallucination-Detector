Problem Statement:

Factuality and Hallucination Detection Framework 
Develop a systematic approach to detect and quantify hallucinations in LLM-generated content, with focus on creating verifiable benchmarks and automated detection methods that don't rely solely on ground truth datasets.Technical Background LLMs frequently generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information. Current detection methods rely heavily on: 
● Expensive ground truth datasets 
● Post-hoc fact-checking against knowledge bases 
● Manual expert verification 
Challenge: Can we develop reliable hallucination detection using intrinsic model signals, consistency checks, and lightweight verification methods?
